<h2>About this resume</h2>
<p>This resume is hosted on AWS, with the content you are reading served from an S3 bucket. The hit counter is incremented
by a serverless application (ANS Lambda), accessed via an API gateway, with the data persisted in an Amazon DynamoDB instance,
a NoSQL database platform. The resume was designed to be an illustration of the skills I have acquired by taking on the
    <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>.   If you are interested in
    learning about AWS or Cloud technologies, check out the link to the challenge, or to the code in <a href="https://github.com/petergreaves/crc">github.</a></p>
